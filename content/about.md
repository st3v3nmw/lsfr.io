# About

**lsfr** /ˈɛl ˈɛs ˈɛf ˈɑr/ *noun*\
Named after the song [_"Love Songs For Robots"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCskw1901a0) by Patrick Watson.

I have always been interested in distributed systems so when I finally got around to reading Designing Data-Intensive Applications, I thought _"you know what, I should actually build some of this stuff to really understand it"_. And that's how _lsfr_ was born: it breaks down complex distributed systems into manageable stages you can implement and test.

Each project teaches fundamentally different concepts through hands-on implementation: strong vs eventual consistency, consensus vs leaderless replication, partitioning strategies, Byzantine fault tolerance, CRDTs. You implement them, test them against network failures and crashes, and understand the trade-offs by experiencing them firsthand.
