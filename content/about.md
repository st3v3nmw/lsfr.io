# About

**lsfr** /ˈɛl ˈɛs ˈɛf ˈɑr/ *noun*\
Named after the song [_"Love Songs For Robots"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCskw1901a0) by Patrick Watson.

[I](https://www.stephenmwangi.com/) have always been interested in distributed systems so when I finally got around to reading Designing Data-Intensive Applications, I thought _"you know what, I should actually build some of this stuff to really understand it"_. And that's how _lsfr_ was born: it breaks down complex systems into stages you can implement and test.

I hope this helps someone out there actually build these systems and learn how they work. I'll be adding more challenges over time 😅.
